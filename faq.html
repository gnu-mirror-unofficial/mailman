 <h3>Mailman Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<b> Q. How do you spell this program?

</b><br> See also <a href="http://www.python.org/cgi-bin/faqw-mm.py">http://www.python.org/cgi-bin/faqw-mm.py</a>
<p> A. You spell it "Mailman", with a leading capital "M" and a lowercase
   second "m".  It is incorrect to spell it "MailMan" (i.e. you should
   not use StudlyCaps).
<p> <b> Q. I'm getting really terrible performance for outgoing messages.  It
   seems that if the MTA has trouble resolving DNS for any recipients,
   qrunner just gets really slow clearing the queue.  Any ideas?

</b><br> A. What's likely happening is that your MTA is doing DNS resolution on
   recipients for messages delivered locally (i.e. from Mailman to
   your MTA via SMTPDirect.py).  This is a Bad Thing.  You need to
   turn off synchronous DNS resolution for messages originating from
   the local host.
<p>    In Exim, the value to edit is receiver_verify_hosts.  See
   README.EXIM for details.  Other MTAs have (of course) different
   parameters and defaults that control this.  First check the README
   file for your MTA and then consult your MTA's own documentation.
<p> <b> Q. What if I get "document contains no data" from the web server, or
   mail isn't getting delivered, or I see "Premature end of script
   headers" or "Mailman CGI error!!!"

</b><br> A. The most likely cause of this is that the GID that is compiled into
   the C wrappers does not match the GID that your Web server invokes
   CGI scripts with.  Note that a similar error could occur if your
   mail system invokes filter programs under a GID that does not match
   the one compiled into the C mail wrapper.
<p>    To fix this you will need to re-configure Mailman using the
   --with-cgi-gid and --with-mail-gid options.  See the INSTALL file
   for details.
<p>    These errors are logged to syslog and they do not show up in the
   Mailman log files.  Problems with the CGI wrapper do get reported
   in the Web browser though, and include the expected GID, so that
   should help a lot.
<p>    You may want to have syslog running and configured to log the
   mail.error log class somewhere; on Solaris systems, the line
<p>        mail.debug                /var/log/syslog
<p>    causes the messages to go to them in /var/log/syslog, for example.
   (The distributed syslog.conf forwards the message to the loghost,
   when present.  See the syslog man page for more details.)
<p>    If your system is set like this, and you get a failure trying to
   visit the mailman/listinfo web page, and it's due to a UID or GID
   mismatch, then you should get an entry at the end of
   /var/log/syslog identifying the expected and received values.
<p> <b> Q. Why do my web pages hang?

</b><br> A. CERN Web servers might leave Python processes running, and in some
   cases might hang the CGI completely.  In that case, switch to
   Apache.
<p>    It is also possible that you have stale locks.  Mailman tries to
   be very careful about the lock files it creates to ensure the
   integrity of its databases, but sometimes system faults can
   cause stale locks to persist.  Look in $prefix/locks for any
   stale list locks and remove them (you can determine if they're
   stale by getting the pid from the file contents and using ps to
   see if those processes are still running or not).
<p> <b> Q. What should I check periodically?

</b><br> A. Many of the scripts have their standard error logged to
   ~mailman/logs/error, and some of the modules write caught errors
   there, as well, so you should check there at least occasionally to
   look for bugs in the code and problems in your setup.
<p>    One thing that is *not* caught by the standard error hook is syntax
   errors, but any of these should have been caught in the
   installation phase, which byte-compiles all .py files in the
   distribution.  There may be syntax errors lurking if you hacked the
   code, or in the scripts that are not modules.
<p>    You can always use the Python module `compile' or `compileall' to
   force byte compilation of a file, or just fire up the Python
   interpreter and try importing the module.
<p> <b> Q. Why doesn't the archive link work?

</b><br> A. Have any messages been posted to the list?  This is a known buglet;
   the archive link doesn't work until at least one message has been
   posted.
<p> <b> Q. Okay, the archive link works, but I can't access the public
   archives.  Why?

</b><br> A. If you are using Apache, you must make sure that FollowSymLinks is
   enabled for the path to the public archives.  Note that the actual
   archives always reside in the private tree, and only when archives
   are public, is the symlink followed. See this archive message for
   more details:
<p>    <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/mailman-users/1998-November/000150.html">http://mail.python.org/pipermail/mailman-users/1998-November/000150.html</a>
<p> <b> Q. Still having problems?  Running QMail?

</b><br> A. Make sure that you are using "preline" before calling "wrapper":
<p>        |preline /home/mailman/mail/wrapper post listname
<p>    "preline" adds a Unix-style "From " header which the archiver requires.
   You can fix the archive mbox files by adding:
<p>        From somebody Mon Oct  9 12:27:34 MDT 2000
<p>    before every message and re-running the archive command
   "bin/arch listname".  The archives should now exist.  See README.QMAIL
   for more information.
<p> <b> Q. Still having problems?  Running on GNU/Linux?

</b><br> A. See the README.LINUX file.
<p> <b> Q. I want to get rid of some messages in my archive.  How do I do
   this?

</b><br> A. David Rocher posts the following recipe:
<p> <li>
    remove $prefix/archives/private/<em>listname</em>
<li>
    edit $prefix/archives/private/<em>listname</em>.mbox/<em>listname</em>.mbox [optional]
<li>
    run $prefix/bin/arch <em>listname</em> 
<p> <b> Q. I set member_posting_only to yes because I want to limit posts to
   members only, however it seems like all messages coming from
   members are held for approval.  Why?

</b><br> A. There appears to be a problem on some systems where the envelope
   sender (e.g. the Unix "From " line) is set incorrectly.  This will
   cause a negative match when checking to see if the sender is a
   member of the list.  Until 1.0b12, Mailman defaulted to using the
   envelope sender before the sender (i.e. "From:" header) because the
   former is set by the SMTP agent while the latter is easily
   spoofable by the end user.
<p>    [ The possible causes for envelope sender munging taking place are
     many, but the "owner-alias" sendmail feature probably deserves
     special mention:
<p>      If mail arrives for list "foo", and there is an alias entry for
     "owner-foo" as well, the envelope sender of the message will be
     changed to the single-level expansion of the "owner-foo" alias.
<p>      Code has been included in post-1.0rc2 Mailman releases to try
     working around the problem this (unconfigurable) sendmail feature
     constitutes.  Prior to this, some people worked around the
     problem by not including the suggested "owner-LISTNAME" alias
     entries for Mailman lists in their alias files. ]
<p>    However, if you are having this problem, you may opt to favor the
   From: header over the envelope sender.  Do this by adding the
   following line to your mm_cfg.py file:
<p>    USE_ENVELOPE_SENDER=0
<p>    if you want (arguably) more security, add this to your mm_cfg.py
   file:
<p>    USE_ENVELOPE_SENDER=1
<p>    However, read the comments about this variable in the Defaults.py
   file for a full discussion of the issues.  By default, Mailman 2.0
   relies on the From: header for doing address matching.
<p> <b> Q. How secure are the authentication mechanisms used in Mailman's web
   interface?

</b><br> A. If your Mailman installation run on an SSL-enabled web server
   (i.e. you access the Mailman web pages with "https://..." URLs),
   you should be as safe as SSL itself is.
<p>    However, most Mailman installation run under standard,
   encryption-unaware servers.  There's nothing wrong with that for
   most applications, but a sufficiently determined cracker *could*
   get unauthorized access by:
<p> <li>
    Packet sniffing: The password used to do the initial
     authentication for any non-public Mailman page is sent as clear
     text over the net.  If you consider this to be a big problem, you
     really should use an SSL-enabled server.
<p> <li>
    Stealing a valid cookie: After successful password
     authentication, Mailman sends a "cookie" back to the user's
     browser.  This cookie will be used for "automatic" authentication
     when browsing further within the list's protected pages.  Mailman
     employs "session cookies" which are set until you quit your
     browser or explicitly log out.
<p>      Gaining access to the user's cookie (e.g. by being able to read
     the user's browser cookie database, or by means of packet
     sniffing, or maybe even by some broken browser offering all it's
     cookies to any and all sites the user accesses), and at the same
     time being able to fulfill the other criteria for using the
     cookie could result in unauthorized access.
<p>      Note that this problem is more easily exploited when users browse
     the web via proxies -- in that case, the cookie would be valid
     for any connections made through that proxy, and not just for
     connections made from the particular machine the user happens to
     be accessing the proxy from.
<p> <li>
    Getting access to the user's terminal: This is really just
     another kind of cookie stealing.  The short cookie expiration
     time is supposed to help defeat this problem.  It can be
     considered the price to pay for the convenience of not having to
     type the password in every time.
