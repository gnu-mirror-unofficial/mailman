<h3>Mailman, the GNU Mailing List Manager</h3>

Mailman is software to help manage electronic mail discussion lists,
much like Majordomo or Smartmail.  Mailman gives each mailing list a
unique web page and allows users to subscribe, unsubscribe, and change
their account options over the web.  Even the list manager can
administer his or her list entirely via the web.  Mailman has most of
the features that people want in a mailing list management system,
including built-in archiving, mail-to-news gateways, spam filters,
bounce detection, digest delivery, and so on.  See the
<a href="features.html">features page</a> for more detail.

<p>Mailman is free software.  It is distributed under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public
License</a>.  The canonical Mailman home page is at
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman.html">
www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman.html</a>, with more information
available at <a href="http://www.list.org/">www.list.org</a>.  Mailman
is written in the <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>
programming language, with a little bit of C code for security.

<p>By the way, the name of this software is spelled <em>Mailman</em>
with a capital leading <em>M</em> and a lowercase second <em>m</em>.
It is incorrect to spell it "MailMan" (i.e. you should not use
StudlyCaps).
