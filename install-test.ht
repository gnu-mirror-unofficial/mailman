<h3>Create a test list</h3>

Create a list named <em>test</em>.  To do so, run the program
<code>$prefix/bin/newlist</code>.  You will be prompted for the name
of the list, as well as the email address of the person running the
list.  Put your own email address as the list administrator's address.
       
<p>Running newlist will generate a list of aliases that must be added
to the system.  If you are running Sendmail, you may add the lines
output directly to the file <code>/etc/aliases</code>.  You may need
to run the command <code>newaliases</code> (all as <b>root</b>).  Now
the mailing address for your list as well as its administrative
addresses will be set up.  If you are not running Sendmail, consult
your MTA's documentation for information on adding aliases.

<p>You will receive email instructions on how to visit the list you
just created.  Using these instructions, subscribe to the mailing
list.  Once you have subscribed (which requires a confirmation step!),
send a message to the list, and see if you get it.  If so, then you
have successfully installed Mailman, and set up your first list!
