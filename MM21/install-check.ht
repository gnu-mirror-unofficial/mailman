Title: Check your installation
Links: links.h install-links.h

<h3>Check your installation</h3>

    After you've run "make install", you can check that your
    installation has all the correct permissions and group ownerships
    by running the check_perms script:

<blockquote>
<pre>
% cd $prefix
% bin/check_perms
</pre>
</blockquote>

    <p>Don't try to run <code>check_perms</code> from the source
    directory; it will only run from the install
    (i.e. <code>$prefix</code>) directory.

    <p>If this reports no problems, then it's very likely that your
    installation is set up correctly <tt>:)</tt> If it reports
    problems, then you can either fix them manually, re-run the
    installation, or use <code>check_perms</code> to fix the problems
    (probably the easiest solution):

    <ul>
    <li>You need to become the user that did the installation (and that
        owns all the files in <code>$prefix</code>), or <b>root</b>.

    <li>Run <code>bin/check_perms -f</code>

    <li>Repeat previous step until no more errors are reported!
    </ul>
