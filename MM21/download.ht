<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>Mailman currently runs only on GNU/Linux and any other Un*x-like
operating system, such as *BSD, Solaris, etc.  It should work on
MacOSX but not earlier versions of MacOS.  It probably does not work
on Windows, although it's possible you could get it running on a
Cygwin system (please <a
href="mailto:mailman-developers@python.org">let the developer
community know</a> if you have success with this!)

<p>
Before you can run Mailman, you need to make sure that
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> is installed.  Mailman 2.1
requires at least Python 2.1, although it is recommended that you use Python
2.1.3 or Python 2.2.1.  Most GNU/Linux systems come with Python
pre-installed, so you just need to make sure you're running an
up-to-date version.  You can do this by executing the following at
your shell's command line:

<blockquote>
<pre>
% python -V
Python 2.1.3
</pre>
</blockquote>

If your Python executable doesn't understand the <code>-V</code>
option, it's probably too old!

<p>You will also need an SMTP server (a.k.a. mail transport agent or
<em>MTA</em>) for mail delivery and reception.  Mailman should work
well with <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a>,
<a href="http://www.exim.org/">Exim</a>,
<a href="http://www.sendmail.org/">Sendmail</a> and
<a href="http://www.qmail.org/">qmail</a>.

<p>You will need a web server.
<a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> is certainly the most
popular, is available for all Unix systems, and works great with
Mailman.

<p>To install Mailman from the sources, you will also need an ANSI C
compiler.  The
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/">GNU C compiler</a>
gcc 2.8.1 or later is known to work well.

<h3>Downloading</h3>

<p>Version
(<!-VERSION--->2.1b2<!-VERSION--->,
released on
<!-DATE--->05-May-2002<!-DATE--->)
is a beta release of the next version.  While the betas seem to be
working quite well, it is still recommended that you use the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103">latest
stable 2.0.x release</a>.  Mailman is
available from the following sources:

<ul>
    <li><a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mailman/">From GNU</a>
    <li><a href="http://www.list.org/mailman.tar.gz">From List.Org</a>
    <li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103">From SourceForge</a>
</ul>

<em>If you're using a command line FTP client, be sure to set the mode
to binary</em>.  Once you've downloaded the source tarball, you can
unpack it with the following commands:

<blockquote>
<pre>
% cd /usr/local/src
% tar zxf mailman.tar.gz
</pre>
</blockquote>

Mailman's tarball unpacks into a directory called
<code>mailman-xyz</code> where <em>xyz</em> is the version number.
Note also that some versions of <code>tar</code> don't accept the
<em>z</em> option.  In that case, you'll need to use the
<code>gunzip</code> program like so:

<blockquote>
<pre>
% gunzip -c mailman.tar.gz | tar xf -
</pre>
</blockquote>
