Links: links.h install-links.h

<h3>Create a test list</h3>

    To create and test your first list, try the following:

    <p><li>First, initialize the site administrator's password by cd'ing to
      the install directory (by default <tt>/usr/local/mailman</tt>)
      and typing

<blockquote>
<pre>
% bin/mmsitepass
New site password: [yourpassword]
Again to confirm password: [yourpassword]
Password changed.
</pre>
</blockquote>

    <p><li>Visit the url

<blockquote>
<pre>
http://my.dom.ain/mailman/create
</pre>
</blockquote>

      <p>Fill out the form as described in the on-screen instructions,
      and in the <em>List creator's password</em> field, type the
      password you entered above.  Type your own email address for the
      <em>Initial list owner address</em>, and select <em>Yes</em> to
      notify the list administrator.

    <p><li>Hit <em>Create List</em>

    <p><li>Check your email for a message from Mailman informing you that
      your new mailing list was created.

    <p><li>NOTE: If you are using an MTA other than Exim or Postfix
      (e.g. Sendmail or Qmail), then you'll need to do the extra step
      of installing the mailing list aliases manually.  Follow the
      instructions in an email message that you should have received
      (you'll need to know how to do this for your particular MTA, see
      the README for your MTA for more information).

    <p><li>Now visit the list's admin page (either by following the link on
      the web page or entering the link from the email Mailman just
      sent you).  Type in the list's password and click on
      <em>Let me in...</em>
    
    <p><li>Click on <em>Membership Management</em> and then on
        <em>Mass Subscription</em>.

    <p><li>Enter your email address in the big text field, and click on
      <em>Submit Your Changes</em>

    <p><li>Now go to your email and send a message to yourlist@my.dom.ain.
      Within a minute or two you should see your message reflected
      back to you via Mailman.

    <p>Congratulations!  You've just set up and tested your first Mailman
    mailing list.  If you had any problems along the way, please see
    the <a href="install-trouble.html">Troubleshooting</a> section.
