<h3>Common Problems FAQ</h3>

    <b>Problem:</b>  All Mailman web pages give a <em>404 File not
    found</em> error.

    <br><b>Solution:</b> Your web server has not been set up properly
        for handling Mailman's cgi commands.  Make sure you've:

        <ol><li>Configured the web server to give permissions to
                <code>$prefix/cgi-bin</code>
            <li>Restarted the web server properly.
        </ol>
        Consult your web server's documentation for instructions
        on how to do these things.

    <p><b>Problem:</b> All Mailman web pages give an <em>Internal
        Server Error</em>.

    <br><b>Solution:</b> The likely problem is that you are using the
        wrong GID or UID for CGI scripts.  Check your syslog.  If you
        see, for example, a line like:

<blockquote>
<pre>
Attempt to exec script with invalid gid 51, expected 99
</pre>
</blockquote>

        You need to reinstall Mailman, and specify
        <code>$CGI_GID</code> to be 51, as described in the
        installation instructions.

    <p><b>Problem:</b>  I send mail to the list, and get back mail saying the
        list is not found!

    <br><b>Solution:</b> You probably didn't add the necessary aliases
        to the system alias database, given to you when you ran the
        <code>newlist</code> command.  If you did add them, you likely
        did not update the alias database, or your system requires you
        to run <code>newaliases</code> explicitly.  Refer to section 5
        above for more information.


    <p><b>Problem:</b>  I send mail to the list, and get back mail saying,
          <em>unknown mailer error</em>.

    <br><b>Solution:</b> The likely problem is that you are using the
        wrong GID or UID for mail.  Check your syslog.  If you see, for
        example, a line like:

<blockquote>
<pre>
Attempt to exec script with invalid gid 51, expected 99
</pre>
</blockquote>

        You need to reinstall Mailman, and specify
        <code>$MAIL_GID</code> to be 51, as described in the
        installation instructions. see notes on Postfix below, as by
        default it will create these problems on installation.


    <p><b>Problem:</b>  I use Postfix for my MTA and the mail wrapper programs
       are logging complaints about the wrong GID.

    <br><b>Solution:</b> Create a separate aliases file for Postfix in its
        <code>main.cf</code> config file under the variable
        <em>alias_maps</em>. Put the file somewhere in Mailman's home
        directory, or somewhere else where the user
        <code>mailman</code> has write access to it; <em>as user
        mailman</em> call Postfix's <code>postalias</code> on the
        alias file.

<blockquote>
<pre>
% postalias the-alias-file
</pre>
</blockquote>

        Also as user mailman, run 

<blockquote>
<pre>
% python -c'import os; print os.getgid()' 
</pre>
</blockquote>

        <p>This should print out the group id that Mailman should be
        configured to expect when the mail wrapper programs are run.
        Call it <em>thegid</em>.  Rebuild Mailman with

<blockquote>
<pre>
% ./configure --with-mail-gid=thegid
</pre>
</blockquote>

    <p><b>Problem:</b>  I send mail to the list, and get back mail saying,
       <em>sh: wrapper not available for sendmail programs</em>

    <br><b>Solution:</b> Your system uses sendmail restricted shell
        (smrsh).  You need to configure smrsh by creating a symbolic
        link from the mail wrapper (<code>$prefix/mail/wrapper</code>)
        to the directory identifying executables allowed to run under
        smrsh.

        <p>Some common names for this directory are
        <code>/var/admin/sm.bin</code>, <code>/usr/admin/sm.bin</code>
        or <code>/etc/smrsh</code>.

        <p>Note that on Debian GNU/Linux, the system makes
        <code>/usr/lib/sm.bin</code>, which is wrong, you will need to
        create the directory <code>/usr/admin/sm.bin</code> and add
        the link there.  Note further that any aliases
        <code>newaliases</code> spits out will need to be adjusted to
        point to the secure link to the wrapper.

    <p><b>Problem:</b>  I messed up when I called configure.  How do I clean
        things up and re-install?

    <br><b>Solution:</b>

<blockquote>
<pre>
% make clean
% ./configure --with-the-right-options
% make install
</pre>
</blockquote>
