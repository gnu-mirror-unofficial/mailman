<h3>Customize Mailman</h3>

    You should do these steps using the account you installed Mailman
    under in section 2 above.

    <ul>
    <li>The file <code>$prefix/Mailman/Defaults.py</code> contains a number of
      defaults for your installation.  If any of these are incorrect,
      override them in <code>$prefix/Mailman/mm_cfg.py</code>, <b>NOT
      IN</b> <code>Defaults.py</code>!  See the comments in
      <code>Defaults.py</code> for details.  Once a list is created,
      editing many of these variables will have no effect At that
      point, you'll need to
      configure your lists through the web admin interface or through
      the command line script <code>bin/config_list</code> or
      <code>bin/withlist</code>. 

      <p>Specifically check to make sure the variables
      <em>DEFAULT_HOST_NAME</em> and <em>DEFAULT_URL</em> are
      correct.  The latter <strong>must</strong> end in a slash.

      <p>The install process will not overwrite an existing
      <code>mm_cfg.py</code> file so you can freely make changes to
      this file.

      <p><b>Note:</b> Do <b>not</b> change <em>HOME_DIR</em> or
      <em>MAILMAN_DIR</em>.  These are set automatically by the
      configure script.

    <p><li>Create the site password using:

<blockquote>
<pre>
$prefix/bin/mmsitepass your-site-password
</pre>
</blockquote>

        <p>This password can be used anywhere that individual user or
        mailing list administrator passwords are required, giving the
        mailman site administrator the ability to adjust these things
        when necessary.

      <p>You may also want to create a password for the site-wide
      <em>list creator</em> role (someone other than the site
      administrator who as privileges to create and remove lists
      through the web).  Use the <tt>-c</tt> option to mmsitepass to
      set this.

     </ul>
