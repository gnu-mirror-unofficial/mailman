<h3> The Mailman Wishlist
</h3>
 Here's the wish list for future versions of Mailman.  Many new
 features have been added to Mailman 2.1, so what's left will
 probably end up in a Mailman 3.0.
 Please also see the Mailman design notes wiki at
 http://www.zope.org/Members/bwarsaw/MailmanDesignNotes/FrontPage
<p>
<h3> Email Handling
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>  Here's the wish list for future versions of Mailman.  Many new
 features have been added to Mailman 2.1, so what's left will
 probably end up in a Mailman 3.0.
 Please also see the Mailman design notes wiki at
 http://www.zope.org/Members/bwarsaw/MailmanDesignNotes/FrontPage

    <li> Re-implement the bulk mailer to do DNS lookups and remote MTA delivery directly (optional).

</ul>
<h3> Documentation
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>  Here's the wish list for future versions of Mailman.  Many new
 features have been added to Mailman 2.1, so what's left will

 Please also see the Mailman design notes wiki at
 http://www.zope.org/Members/bwarsaw/MailmanDesignNotes/FrontPage

    <li> Re-implement the bulk mailer to do DNS lookups and remote MTA delivery directly (optional).

    <li> A detailed feature list
    <li> A user's guide
    <li> A site-admin's guide
    <li> A list-admin's guide
    <li> More on-line documentation and UI help
    <li> A developer's guide w/ architecture and API information
    <li> manpages for the scripts in bin and cron
    <li> Integrate Christopher Kolar's documentation
</ul>
<h3> General Web UI

    <li> manpages for the scripts in bin and cron
    <li> Integrate Christopher Kolar's documentation
    <li> NO DEAD ENDS and every web page is reachable.
    <li> All web UI must be configurable so that it more easily integrates into an existing site's design.  Probably means using
 a better template language/system like Zope's Presentation
 Templates, Quixote, or PHP.

    <li> Default UI should add a navigation sidebar to all web pages.
    <li> Web pages should never mention disabled features.

 message was edited by the moderator).

    <li> Allow the admin to disable option settings by users
    <li> Allow admins to control and set individual headers, adding, removing, or overriding those in the original message (sometimes
 very useful, but could be dangerous!)

    <li> New moderation choice: archive but don't send to list.
    <li> New moderation choice: annotate and send to author for resubmittal.
    <li> Better integration with moderated newsgroups (and allow some addresses to bypass even that moderation and be delivered to a
 secondary channel, like moderators@isc.org).

    <li> Have one account per user per site, with multiple email addresses and fallbacks.  Allow them to subscribe whichever
 address they want to whichever list, with different options per
 subscription.

    <li> Allow the user to get BOTH normal and digested delivery (but I still don't understand why someone would want this)

    <li> More flexible digests: index digests (subject and authors only, with URLs to retrieve the article)

    <li> Timed vacations, allowing a user to postpone or discard email for a certain number of days or weeks.

    <li> Keep user-centric stats, such as the date the user was subscribed, the date of their last change to their account, the
 date they last sent a message through the list.  Perhaps also
 log each message they send through the list.

 by addressing it to mailman@site.dom).

    <li> Allow lists of the same name in two different virtual domains
    <li> Should be able to gather statistics, such as deliveries/day, performance, number of subscribers over time, etc.

    <li> Implement something like Roundup's nosy lists, maybe even integrate with Roundup.

    <li> Split Mailman into libraries so, e.g. the delivery part could be used by other projects.

</ul>
<h3> Bounce handling
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>  Here's the wish list for future versions of Mailman.  Many new
 features have been added to Mailman 2.1, so what's left will
 probably end up in a Mailman 3.0.
 Please also see the Mailman design notes wiki at
 http://www.zope.org/Members/bwarsaw/MailmanDesignNotes/FrontPage

    <li> Re-implement the bulk mailer to do DNS lookups and remote MTA delivery directly (optional).

    <li> A detailed feature list
    <li> A user's guide
    <li> A site-admin's guide
    <li> A list-admin's guide
    <li> More on-line documentation and UI help
    <li> A developer's guide w/ architecture and API information
    <li> manpages for the scripts in bin and cron
    <li> Integrate Christopher Kolar's documentation
    <li> NO DEAD ENDS and every web page is reachable.
    <li> All web UI must be configurable so that it more easily integrates into an existing site's design.  Probably means using
 a better template language/system like Zope's Presentation
 Templates, Quixote, or PHP.

    <li> Default UI should add a navigation sidebar to all web pages.
    <li> Web pages should never mention disabled features.
    <li> Allow the moderator to edit posts being held for approval (make it evident, either through a header or other means that the
 message was edited by the moderator).

    <li> Allow the admin to disable option settings by users
    <li> Allow admins to control and set individual headers, adding, removing, or overriding those in the original message (sometimes
 very useful, but could be dangerous!)

    <li> New moderation choice: archive but don't send to list.
    <li> New moderation choice: annotate and send to author for resubmittal.
    <li> Better integration with moderated newsgroups (and allow some addresses to bypass even that moderation and be delivered to a
 secondary channel, like moderators@isc.org).

    <li> Have one account per user per site, with multiple email addresses and fallbacks.  Allow them to subscribe whichever
 address they want to whichever list, with different options per
 subscription.

    <li> Allow the user to get BOTH normal and digested delivery (but I still don't understand why someone would want this)

    <li> More flexible digests: index digests (subject and authors only, with URLs to retrieve the article)

    <li> Timed vacations, allowing a user to postpone or discard email for a certain number of days or weeks.

    <li> Keep user-centric stats, such as the date the user was subscribed, the date of their last change to their account, the
 date they last sent a message through the list.  Perhaps also
 log each message they send through the list.

    <li> Allow the site admin to define list styles or themes, and list admins to choose one of the canned styles to apply to their
 list.

    <li> Allow the site admin to send an email message to all the list admins using a mechanism similar to the Urgent: header (possibly
 by addressing it to mailman@site.dom).

    <li> A better strategy is needed for sub-lists and super-lists, including dealing with the resulting password reminders and
 authorization to modify the sub & superlists.

    <li> Add a limit on the number of posts from any one individual within a period of time (1 post per day, 10 per week, etc).
 Also, limits on mailbacks, infos, etc.

    <li> Provide an email interface to all administrative commands
    <li> Allow email unsubs from matching address to unsubscribe, possibly adding an "allow open unsubscribes" option to control
 this.  Also, adding a confirmation with click-thru confirmation
 to resubscribe.

    <li> For email subscribes, keep an audit of where requests are coming from, and send the original request headers in the confirmation
 message.  Helps track down subscribe bombs.

    <li> Investigate Majordomo2's email admin capabilities.
    <li> Support the `which' command.
    <li> Use a real transactional database for all information, and allow various bits of information to come from different sources (a
 relational database, ZODB, LDAP, etc)

    <li> Member profiles
    <li> Allow lists of the same name in two different virtual domains
    <li> Should be able to gather statistics, such as deliveries/day, performance, number of subscribers over time, etc.

    <li> Implement something like Roundup's nosy lists, maybe even integrate with Roundup.

    <li> Split Mailman into libraries so, e.g. the delivery part could be used by other projects.

    <li> Add more patterns for bounce handling (never ending)
    <li> Send mail to people who are being removed without their knowledge (even though they're likely not to get it).
