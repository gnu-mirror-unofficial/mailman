<h3>Mailman, the GNU Mailing List Manager</h3>

Mailman is software to help manage electronic mail discussion lists.
Mailman gives each mailing list a unique web page and allows users to
subscribe, unsubscribe, and change their account options over the web.
Even the list manager can administer his or her list entirely via the
web.  Mailman has most of the features that people want in a mailing
list management system, including built-in archiving, mail-to-news
gateways, spam filters, bounce detection, digest delivery, and so on.
See the <a href="features.html">features page</a> for more detail.

<p>Mailman is free software.  It is distributed under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public
License</a>.  The canonical Mailman home page is at
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/">
www.gnu.org/software/mailman</a>, which is mirrored at
<a href="http://www.list.org/">www.list.org</a> and
<a href="http://sf.net/projects/mailman">SourceForge</a>.  Mailman
is written in the <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>
programming language, with a little bit of C code for security.

<p>By the way, the name of this software is spelled <em>Mailman</em>
with a capital leading <em>M</em> and a lowercase second <em>m</em>.
It is incorrect to spell it "MailMan" (i.e. you should not use
StudlyCaps).

<h3>Current Version</h3>

<p>Version
(<!-VERSION--->2.1b6<!-VERSION--->,
released on
<!-DATE--->09-Dec-2002<!-DATE--->)
is the current development release of the next version of Mailman.
This version is stable and is being used in some production
environments, but it may still have some lurking bugs.  If you decide
