<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>Mailman currently runs only on Unix-y systems, such as GNU/Linux,
Solaris, *BSD, etc.  It should work on MacOSX but not earlier versions
of MacOS.  It probably does not work on Windows, although it's
possible you could get it running on a Cygwin system (please
<a href="mailto:mailman-developers@python.org">let the developer
community know</a> if you have success with this!)

<p>
Before you can run Mailman, you need to make sure that
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> is installed.  Mailman
requires at least Python 1.5.2 and is known to work with Python 1.6
and Python 2.0.  Most GNU/Linux systems come with Python pre-installed, so
you just need to make sure you're running an up-to-date version.  You
can do this by executing the following at your shell's command line:

<blockquote>
<pre>
% python
Python 2.0 (#128, Oct 18 2000, 04:48:44) 
[GCC egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)] on linux2
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> ^D
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You will also need a mail server (a.k.a. SMTP server, mail
transport agent or <em>MTA</em>) for mail delivery and reception.
Mailman is MTA-agnostic, meaning it should work with just about any
mail server.  Among the servers used by the Mailman community include
<a href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a>,
<a href="http://www.exim.org/">Exim</a>,
<a href="http://www.sendmail.org/">Sendmail</a>, and Qmail.

<p>You will need a web server.
<a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> is certainly the most
popular, is available for all Unix systems, and works great with
Mailman.

<p>To install Mailman from the sources, you will also need an ANSI C
compiler.  The
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/">GNU C compiler</a>
gcc 2.8.1 or later is known to work well.

<h3>Downloading</h3>

<p>Version
(<!-VERSION--->2.0.13<!-VERSION--->,
released on
<!-DATE--->Jul 29 2002<!-DATE--->)
is the current GNU release.  It is available from the following mirror sites:

<ul>
    <li><a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mailman/">From GNU</a>
    <li><a href="http://www.list.org/mailman.tar.gz">From List.Org</a>
    <li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103">From SourceForge</a>
</ul>

<em>If you're using a command line FTP client, be sure to set the mode
to binary</em>.  Once you've downloaded the source tarball, you can
unpack it with the following commands:

<blockquote>
<pre>
% cd /usr/local/src
% tar zxf mailman.tar.gz
</pre>
</blockquote>

Mailman's tarball unpacks into a directory called
<code>mailman-xyz</code> where <em>xyz</em> is the version number.
Note also that some versions of <code>tar</code> don't accept the
<em>z</em> option.  In that case, you'll need to use the
<code>gunzip</code> program like so:

<blockquote>
<pre>
% gunzip -c mailman.tar.gz | tar xf -
</pre>
</blockquote>
